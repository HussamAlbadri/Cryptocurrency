    <!-- Defination about cryptocurrency -->
    <section>
      <p> A cryptocurrency is a digital or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-currency.asp">virtual currency</a> that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

    <!-- cryptocurrency Types -->
    <section>
      <p> There are many types of cryptocurrency, i will mention some of them </p>
      <ul>
        <li><h2> Bitcoin </h2></li>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851190421689335839/864859019759059014/BTC-2.png" alt="BitCoin" width="300" height="200"/> 
        <p> Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.1 The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and, unlike government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority.


       Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. There is no physical bitcoin, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to. All bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoin is not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor is an individual bitcoin valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender in most parts of the world, bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins. Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as "BTC." </p>

       <li> <h2> Ethereum </h2> </li>
       <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851190421689335839/864859974102155304/1200px-Ethereum-icon-purple.png" alt="Ethereum" width="200" height="250"/>
       <p>Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum, and its own programming language, called Solidity.


       As a blockchain network, Ethereum is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The network's users can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, and use its Ether cryptocurrency as payment. Insiders call the decentralized applications on the network "dapps."


       As a cryptocurrency, Ethereum is second in market value only to Bitcoin, as of May 2021 </p>

       <li> <h2> Litecoin </h2> </li>
       <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851190421689335839/864861097357606912/litecoin_main.png " alt="Litecoin" width="300" height="200" />
       <p> Litecoin (LTC) is an alternative cryptocurrency created in October 2011 by Charles "Charlie" Lee. Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin (BTC). Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is based on an open-source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in aspects like faster block generation rate and use of Scrypt as a proof of work scheme.</p>
