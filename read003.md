## What is **HTML**?
HTML stands for complete hypertext markup language, and it is a formatting method for displaying information acquired from the Internet. A Web page (from the World Wide Web) is a retrieval unit that frequently contains hypertext links that allow similar pages to be accessed. The markup language for encoding Web pages is HTML. It was created in the 1980s at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland by British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Headings, paragraphs, and tables are all defined using HTML markup tags. They format a document so that it may be seen by a computer program called a Web browser.

**HTML** is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. Instead, with HTML, web users can create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. 

Here are some of the most common uses for HTML:
- **Web development**. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
- **Internet navigation**. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
- **Web documentation**. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

## Most Used HTML Tags and HTML Elements

- **Block-Level Elements**

A block-level element takes up the entire width of a page. It always starts a new line in the document. For example, a heading element will be in a separate line from a paragraph element.
Every **HTML** page uses these three tags:
+ <*html*> tag is the root element that defines the whole HTML document.
+ <*head*> tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset.
+ <*body*> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.

### Other popular block-level tags include:

* **Heading tags** – these range from <*h1*> to <*h6*>, where heading h1 is largest in size, getting smaller as they move up to h6. 
* **Paragraph tags** – are all enclosed by using the <*p*> tag.
* **List tags** – have different variations. Use the <*ol*> tag for an ordered list, and use <*ul*> for an unordered list. Then, enclose individual list items using the <*li*> tag.
